This project simulates a task scheduler for coordinating multiple autonomous harvesting robots in a grid based farm environment.

Key Features of this Project:

-Task Scheduling: Each robot is designed a task that require fruit picking requirement. These task are assigned at the start of each simulation and are constantly changing requirements. When task are complete it notifies.

-Autonomous Robots: Each robot navigates the farm, are able to detect nearby fruits, other robots, and barriers. They nagivate these obstacles and return the fruit back to 'base' in the most effcient way possible.

-Encrypted Messages: When robots deliver the fruits back to 'base' the message is encrypted (and translated), allowing for secure communication between robots and us.

-Visualization: The environment is a 15x15 layout with randomly placed fruits and obstacles. Output is both printed through python with dots,letters, ect and live through pygame with a color cordinated layout.
