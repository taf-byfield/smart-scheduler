This project simulates a smart task scheduler for coordinating multiple harvesting robots in a farm environment. It utilizes:
	- A  Task organizer that implements scheduling algorithms to optimize robot assignments and maximize efficiency
	- Simulated robots with movement logic and path planning to avoid collision
	- A Grid based virtual farm that mimics the layout of a farm and fruit location
	- Secure communication between robots
	- Visualization tools to monitor robot performance and behavior.
